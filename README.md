# Themes-Extractor
Just a program which extracts all theme files from file level.lsb. 
You can just simply drag your file(level.lsb) in Console App on the first question.
And also you can drag folder in Console App on the second question.
Edit(3rd May/2020): Added a new feature called "Prefabs Extractor".
You can now extract all prefab files from level.lsb.
There is also a secret word which can open some secrets of this program.
